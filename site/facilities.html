					<p>The ECSL is located in the Science Center Research Complex adjacent to Drexel's University City Campus, and encompasses approximately 1500 sq ft of space equipped with two fume hoods. The laboratory is equipped to perform advanced performance diagnostics of static and flow-assisted electrochemical systems and conduct a wide variety of performance diagnostics, wet chemistry, synthesis, manufacturing procedures, and computational studies. </p>
					<p>Some of the major equipment in ECSL includes: a fully automated redox cell test system for testing of static and flow-assisted electrochemical devices, a high-temperature fuel cell testing station, a potentiostat/galvanostat configured with multiple channels and current booster, a high performance modeling workstation with dual hex-core Intel Xeon processors and 96 GB of RAM, a TAIG Tools Micro Mill DSLS 3000 vertical CNC milling machine, an electrochemical flow capacitor testing station, a Carbolite CTF 17/25/300 tube furnace capable of up to 1700Â°C, and several peristaltic and syringe pumps. ECSL also has a complete wet lab setup including two chemical fume hoods, a precision micro-balance, ultrasonicator, stirring hot plates, and high performance computer workstations with COMSOL, Abaqus, ANSYS, Pro/ENGINEER, AutoCAD, and MATLAB.</p>
